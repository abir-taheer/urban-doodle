# FPDF Library
If you need to use the auto-watermark for PDF materials approval, that requires the use of the FPDF library. Install the latest version here: http://www.fpdf.org/

This app was made to be compatible with v1.81

Once you have downloaded the files from http://www.fpdf.org/, extract them here such that the **fpdf.php** file can be found in the root of this directory
